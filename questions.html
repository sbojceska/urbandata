				  <strong>What is the dataset? <br></strong>
				  The dataset is Country of Birth of person by Year of Arrival in Australia. <br>

				  <strong>Why is the dataset collected? <br></strong>
				  This dataset is collected to outline the diversities by country of birth in Australia. <br>

				  <strong>Which government department do you think will use this? <br></strong> 
				  Such type of dataset would be useful for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. <br>

				  <strong>Which private sector will use this? <br></strong>
				  This dataset could be used within private corporations. <br>

				  <strong>How would this dataset change the way you think about space? <br></strong>
				  It allows governmental bodies to analyse the use of space based on cultural differences. <br> 
				  For instance, it could be an indicator of where cultural facilities should be placed. <br>

				  <strong>How does this dataset change across Sydney?<br></strong>
				  Those of ethnic origin (Non-western Europeans) tend to stay closer to each other in <br>
				  select clusters around Sydney. Whilst those of Western European decent are more likely<br>
				  to spread out with no identifiable clusters, with the majority closer to the city. <br>

				  <strong>How does it relate to the latte line?<br></strong>
				  Most residents from regions other than Europe tend to live south of the latte line.<br>
				  This can be stemmed from the fact that many of these residents are first wave immigrants<br>
				  with naturally lower pay, resulting in the lack of on-the-go coffees. <br>

				  <strong>How has the dataset changed between 2011 and 2016?<br></strong>
				  The only significant changes are the slight increase of cluster density, with more people<br>
				  of the same ethnicity residing in the same area; and the expansion of most clusters. <br>

				  <strong> How is this dataset significate to peopleâ€™s lives? <br></strong>
				  It allows both long-time citizens or those fresh off the boat know where their ethnic<br>
				  group is most likely located, allowing the feeling of a 'home away from home' with <br>
				  those of the same ethnicity. <br>

				  <strong>Would it be good for this data to change? <br></strong>
				  Not necessarily, the dataset effectively shows location of ethnic populations through <br>
				  years of arrival. 
				  If you wanted to change it, how would you change it? <br>
				  If there was to be a change, it would be most likely reducing the years covered in one<br>
				  dataset. It will provide a far more detailed insight into when immigrants came into <br>
				  Australia.
